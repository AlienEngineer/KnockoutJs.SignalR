## KnockoutJs.SignalR

### Library that merges KnockoutJs and SignalR
The idea for this project is to be able to use SignalR in combination with KnockoutJs as one library.

Random ideas:
* Conventions
 * The ViewMovel should have a Hub ( Maybe the hub name should be equal to the ViewModels name)
 * applyBindings could Start the hub connection.
